# Outline
Dark patterns are deceptive design choices in user interfaces that manipulate users into taking actions they might not have intended. These patterns can infringe on user privacy, lead to unintended financial commitments, or create misleading experiences.

This project aims to:
- Educate users on what dark patterns are and their impact.
- Showcase real-world examples and statistics on their prevalence.
- Highlight the most common and harmful dark patterns.
- Provide actionable steps for users to recognize and combat them.
- Collect user-submitted examples to build a dataset of observed dark patterns.
By making this information interactive and engaging, the project seeks to raise awareness and encourage ethical design practices.

## Goal, Target Audience & Call to Action
### Goal Statement:
As a general internet user, I want to understand how dark patterns in UX manipulate my actions, so that I can recognize and avoid deceptive designs that compromise my privacy and financial security.

### Target Audience:
General users, primarily 18-65 years old as they are the most active users of websites and apps, who are unaware of dark patterns.

### Call to Action:
I can do this by raising awareness about dark patterns, educating others on how to spot them, and contributing to a crowdsourced dataset of real-world dark pattern examples.

### Future Action:
The collected user-submitted data will help in building a dataset that can be analyzed further to understand emerging trends in deceptive UX design.

## Project Structure & Story Flow
### Introduction (Engagement Hook – Interactive Quiz)
- A short, interactive quiz with 5 questions.
- Users will be shown two images and asked to identify which one uses a dark pattern.
- The goal is to make users aware of how easily they can be deceived.
### Section 1: Understanding Dark Patterns
- Definition of dark patterns in UX.
- Overview of their role in privacy and security violations.
- Real-world examples from popular websites/apps.
### Section 2: Impact of Dark Patterns
- Statistics on how dark patterns affect users (privacy breaches, financial loss, etc.).
- Research-backed insights on user deception.
- Examples of the most common dark patterns with explanations.
### Section 3: Types of Dark Patterns
- Breakdown of various types of dark patterns (e.g., Forced Continuity, Roach Motel, Hidden Costs).
- Brief explanation of each with visuals and real-world applications.
### Section 4: Combating Dark Patterns
- Ethical design principles and best practices.
- Steps users can take to identify and avoid dark patterns.
- Role of regulations (e.g., GDPR, FTC guidelines) in reducing dark patterns.
### Section 5: User Contribution – Building a Dataset
- A form allowing users to submit dark patterns they have encountered.
- Data collection to create a repository of deceptive UX practices. 

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project. 

For my final project, I will use a combination of **Excel, Tableau, and Shorthand** to create an interactive and engaging experience:  

- **Excel**: I will manipulate and clean the dataset, including any collected user-submitted data on dark patterns.  
- **Tableau**: I will create visualizations to illustrate statistics on dark patterns, their impact, and common types. These visualizations will be published on Tableau Public and embedded into the project.  
- **Shorthand**: I will use Shorthand to design the final interactive story, incorporating text, images, quizzes, and embedded Tableau visualizations to guide the user through the narrative.  

This approach ensures a data-driven, visually engaging, and interactive experience that effectively communicates the impact of dark patterns in UX.
