# Wireframes & Visualizations

## Overview of Storyboarding:
In this section, I have developed a visual walkthrough of the story, incorporating both data visualizations and narrative flow. I used the Shorthand platform to construct the draft of my story and included high-fidelity Tableau visualizations that represent the critical data points central to my narrative. These elements will be further refined as I gather user feedback from the research phase.

## Tableau Visualizations Snippets
Below are two Tableau visualizations I’ve created, which I have included in my Shorthand story. These visualizations highlight the core aspects of my data narrative, offering insights that will guide the audience through the story.

1. Visualization 1: [Share of Dark Patterns by Industry](https://public.tableau.com/views/DarkPatternsacrossIndustries/ShareofDarkPatternsbyIndustry?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)



2. Visualization 2: [Top 5 Dark Patterns observed in Ecommerce](https://public.tableau.com/views/Ecommerce_Darkpatterns/Top5DarkPatternsobservedinEcommerce?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

# User research 

## Target audience
For my user research, I have focused on individuals who shop frequently, primarily within the age range of 18 to 55. Initially, I considered a broader age range of 18 to 65, but after receiving feedback that the range was too wide, I have narrowed it to 18-55. This more focused range is based on a survey from Dovetail, which suggests that people in this demographic are more likely to be engaged in online shopping regularly. This group includes a variety of shoppers who engage in both occasional and frequent online shopping, providing a broad yet relevant perspective for my project.

## Interview script
The goal of my user research was to assess different aspects of my story’s visual design, flow, and the relevance of the data visualizations. Below are the key areas I aimed to evaluate through the interviews:
### Theme and Aesthetics
- Is the overall theme of the page too dark or uninviting?
- How does the image that I used on the title page (A photo of a black and white shopping cart) feel to users? Is it too dull?
- Do users like the overall flow of the story and its progression?

### Data visualizations:
- Feedback on the two visualizations-
  - A pie chart showing market share distribution among industries for Dark Patterns.
  - A bar graph that compares online shopping trends across different sectors.
- Do these visualizations feel appropriate for the data, or would the users prefer alternative visualizations for better clarity or engagement?

### Scrollmation and Interactive Elements
- Does the scrollmation feature (where users interact with a quiz or view the different types of dark patterns) resonate with the users?
- Are users comfortable with this interactive design element? Do they find it engaging and effective in delivering key insights?

### Precautionary Steps Section
- Do users find the section about precautionary steps too plain or lackluster?
- If yes, how can this section be improved visually to enhance engagement or provide clearer information?

## Interview findings
The following findings are based on user interviews conducted to gather feedback on various aspects of the story’s design, including visual appeal, content flow, and interactive elements. These insights will guide the refinement of the project moving forward.

### Interview Findings

| **Questions**                                                            | **Interview 1**                                                    | **Interview 2**                                                    | **Interview 3**                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Is the overall theme of the page too dark or uninviting for the target audience?** | "I like the dark theme. It feels sleek and modern."                 | "The dark theme works for me. It feels engaging and immersive."    | The dark theme was appreciated for its aesthetic appeal.           |
| **How does the image that I used on the title page (A photo of a black and white shopping cart) feel to users? Is it too dull?** | "Is it a shopping cart? Honestly, it doesn’t really matter to me." | "I’m not sure what the image is, but I don’t think it’s important." | "The image could be clearer. I’d reduce the black overlay on top, but it’s not a dealbreaker." |
| **Do users like the overall flow of the story and its progression?**   | "Yes, the story flows well and is easy to follow."                 | "The progression is smooth, and everything fits together well."    | "I liked how everything connected. The pacing is great."           |
| **Do these visualizations feel appropriate for the data, or would the users prefer alternative visualizations for better clarity or engagement?** | "The pie chart was fine, but I think showing just the top 4 would make it cleaner." | "I had trouble reading the pie chart, a bar chart would be better." | "The pie chart was a bit too much. I’d prefer a bar graph, and maybe just the top 4 categories." |
| **Does the scrollmation feature (where users interact with a quiz or view the different types of dark patterns) resonate with the users?** | "I loved the scrollmation—it’s a fun way to interact and learn about the patterns!" | "The scrollmation is cool. I liked the quiz part especially."     | "It was unique and engaging, especially the quiz part."            |
| **Are users comfortable with this interactive design element? Do they find it engaging and effective in delivering key insights?** | "Yes, it keeps me engaged, and I feel like I’m learning while interacting." | "It works well, but adding some stats for each type of dark pattern would make it more informative." | "I’m comfortable with it and feel like it delivers key information effectively." |
| **Do users find the section about precautionary steps too plain or lackluster?** | "It’s a bit plain. Maybe some icons could make it more visually interesting." | "It’s not too plain for me—it’s straightforward and easy to read." | "It could use some images to break it up and make it more engaging." |
