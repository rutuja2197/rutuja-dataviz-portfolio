# Wireframes & Visualizations

## Overview of Storyboarding:
In this section, I have developed a visual walkthrough of the story, incorporating both data visualizations and narrative flow. I used the Shorthand platform to construct the draft of my story and included high-fidelity Tableau visualizations that represent the critical data points central to my narrative. These elements will be further refined as I gather user feedback from the research phase.

## Tableau Visualizations Snippets
Below are two Tableau visualizations I’ve created, which I have included in my Shorthand story. These visualizations highlight the core aspects of my data narrative, offering insights that will guide the audience through the story.

### Visualization 1: 
<b>Previous version:</b>
A pie chart illustrating the distribution of dark patterns across different industries, highlighting which sectors employ these deceptive tactics most frequently.

<b>Updated version:</b>
Modified this to a bar graph.

### Visualization 2: 
<b>Previous version:</b>
A bar graph comparing the prevalence of different dark patterns observed in e-commerce, showing their occurrence percentages.

<b>Updated version:</b>
A refined version highlighting only the top five most commonly observed dark patterns in e-commerce for clearer insights.

# User research 

## Target audience
For my user research, I have focused on individuals who shop frequently, primarily within the age range of 18 to 55. Initially, I considered a broader age range of 18 to 65, but after receiving feedback that the range was too wide, I have narrowed it to 18-55. This more focused range is based on a survey from Dovetail, which suggests that people in this demographic are more likely to be engaged in online shopping regularly. This group includes a variety of shoppers who engage in both occasional and frequent online shopping, providing a broad yet relevant perspective for my project.

## Interview script
The goal of my user research was to assess different aspects of my story’s visual design, flow, and the relevance of the data visualizations. Below are the key areas I aimed to evaluate through the interviews:
### Theme and Aesthetics
- Is the overall theme of the page too dark or uninviting?
- How does the image that I used on the title page (The photo of black and white shopping cart) feel to users? Is it too dull?
- Do users like the overall flow of the story and its progression?

### Data visualizations:
- Feedback on the two visualizations-
  - A pie chart showing market share distribution of Dark Patterns among different industries.
  - A bar graph illustrating the prevalence of different dark patterns observed in e-commerce, comparing their occurrence percentages/occurences.
- Do these visualizations feel appropriate for the data, or would the users prefer alternative visualizations for better clarity or engagement?

### Scrollmation and Interactive Elements
- Does the scrollmation feature (where users interact with a quiz or view the different types of dark patterns) resonate with the users?
- Are users comfortable with this interactive design element? Do they find it engaging and effective in delivering key insights?

### Precautionary Steps Section
- Do users find the section about precautionary steps too plain or lackluster?
- If yes, how can this section be improved visually to enhance engagement or provide clearer information?

## Interview findings
The following findings are based on user interviews conducted to gather feedback on various aspects of the story’s design, including visual appeal, content flow, and interactive elements. These insights will guide the refinement of the project moving forward.

### Interview Findings

| **Questions**                                                            | **Interview 1**                                                    | **Interview 2**                                                    | **Interview 3**                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Is the overall theme of the page too dark or uninviting for the target audience?** | "I like the dark theme. It feels sleek and modern."                 | "The dark theme works for me. It feels suitable for the topic."    | The dark theme was liked by this participant as well.           |
| **How does the image that I used on the title page (A photo of a black and white shopping cart) feel to users? Is it too dull?** | "Is it a shopping cart? Honestly, I feel it doesn’t really matter." | Found the image unclear but didn't think it was a big issue. | Suggested reducing the black overlay on the image to improve clarity, though they felt it wasn’t a major problem. |
| **Do users like the overall flow of the story and its progression?**   | Felt the story flow was well and easy to follow.                | The story’s progression felt intuitive and engaging for this participant as well.    | Found the flow clear and well-structured.           |
| **Do these visualizations feel appropriate for the data, or would the users prefer alternative visualizations for better clarity or engagement?** | The first visualization was well-received, but the second one could be simplified to show just the top 4 instead of 8. | Suggested replacing the pie chart with a bar graph, as the pie chart was hard to read, but liked the second visualization. |The bar chart was preferred over the pie chart for the first visualization and also felt showing only the top 4/5 would improve readability. | 
| **Does the scrollmation feature (where users interact with a quiz or view the different types of dark patterns) resonate with the users?** | The scrollmation feature was well-liked. | Liked the scrollmation, especially the quiz part, and found it engaging.     | Found it a fun addition to the page.            |
| **Are users comfortable with this interactive design element? Do they find it engaging and effective in delivering key insights?** | Found the interactive design element effective and engaging, although suggested reducing the types of dark patterns explained to 4-5 instead of 10 | "It works well, but adding some stats for each type of dark pattern would make it more informative." | "I’m comfortable with it and feel like it delivers key information effectively." |
| **Do users find the section about precautionary steps too plain or lackluster?** | Felt the section was a bit too plain and suggested adding icons to make it more visually interesting. | Didn’t find it too plain and thought it was easier to read without additional elements. | "It could use some images to break it up and make it more engaging." |


# Identified changes for Part III 

Based on the insights gathered from user interviews, the following synthesis outlines key observations and the anticipated changes for Part III of the project. These adjustments aim to enhance the visual appeal, interactivity, and clarity of the story.

| **Research synthesis**                                               | **Anticipated changes for Part III**                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Users liked the dark theme and found it engaging.                   | Keep the dark theme, as it resonates well with the audience.                                                              |
| The title page image (shopping cart) was unclear for some users. | Consider changing the image or making it clearer.                                      |
| The overall flow of the story was well-received.                     | No major changes needed to the flow, perhaps add a section to show the statistical effect of different dark patterns.                                              |
| Participants felt the pie chart was hard to read and preferred bar charts for the first visualization. | Replace the pie chart with a bar chart for better clarity, and reduce the categories shown to top 5 for better readability.    |
| The scrollmation feature was appreciated for its interactivity.     | Maintain the scrollmation feature, but consider adding more stats for each type of dark pattern to enhance engagement. Also, only explain the most relevant types of dark patterns, perhaps 5 instead of 10.     |
| The precautionary steps section was perceived as plain by some users. | Add relevant icons or images to make the precautionary steps section more visually engaging and less plain.               |                                                           

In addition to the above changes, I will replace the current Tableau snippets with embedded links to provide a more interactive experience for users. This will allow them to explore the data in greater detail, improving engagement and clarity. These refinements, based on user feedback, will help create a more visually appealing and user-friendly final presentation. 

# Color Palette
I used Canva to generate a refined color palette, ensuring a visually cohesive and engaging design.
