# About me
Hi, I’m Rutuja (she/her)! I’m currently a student enrolled in Master of Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University. My academic and professional journey is deeply rooted in solving complex business challenges, and I thrive in dynamic environments where I can apply my expertise in tools like MySQL, Tableau, Python, and Excel to create impactful, data-driven solutions. I’m passionate about collaborating on projects that challenge my problem-solving abilities and allow me to contribute to meaningful initiatives.

Outside of academics, I enjoy spending quality time with my dog and going on hikes with him. Painting is one of my favorite hobbies, and I had the opportunity to serve as the head of set design for my college drama group. As a travel enthusiast, I love exploring new places and savoring local cuisines with my family and friends. These experiences fuel my curiosity and bring balance to my academic and professional pursuits.

# What I hope to learn
I aim to build a strong foundation in designing compelling and effective data visualizations. 

- Learn best practices for storytelling with data to make complex information accessible and actionable.
- Gain experience in designing visually appealing and accurate dashboards.
- Use data visualizations as a strategic tool in consulting to drive better decision-making.
- Build skills to craft data-driven narratives that influence, inspire, and support strategic goals.
- Explore how typography and color choices influence the clarity and emotional impact of visualizations.
