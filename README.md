# About me
Hi, I’m Rutuja (she/her)! I’m currently a student enrolled in Master of Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University. My academic and professional journey is deeply rooted in solving complex business challenges, and I thrive in dynamic environments where I can apply my expertise in tools like MySQL, Tableau, Python, and Excel to create impactful, data-driven solutions. I’m passionate about collaborating on projects that challenge my problem-solving abilities and allow me to contribute to meaningful initiatives.

Outside of academics, I enjoy spending quality time with my dog and going on hikes with him. Painting is one of my favorite hobbies, and I had the opportunity to serve as the head of set design for my college drama group. As a travel enthusiast, I love exploring new places and savoring local cuisines with my family and friends. These experiences fuel my curiosity and bring balance to my academic and professional pursuits.

# What I hope to learn
I aim to build a strong foundation in designing compelling and effective data visualizations. 

- Learn best practices for storytelling with data to make complex information accessible and actionable.
- Gain experience in designing visually appealing and accurate dashboards.
- Use data visualizations as a strategic tool in consulting to drive better decision-making.
- Build skills to craft data-driven narratives that influence, inspire, and support strategic goals.
- Explore how typography and color choices influence the clarity and emotional impact of visualizations.

## Data Critiques  
This section includes a critique I worked on. I analyzed a visualization from the MakeoverMonday website, evaluating its design and effectiveness. I then created my own improved version using Tableau, applying design principles to enhance clarity and impact. <br>

## Final Project: Part one 
Part One marks the beginning of my final project on dark patterns in UX. I focused on identifying key dark patterns in e-commerce and started to develop a data-driven narrative to educate users about these deceptive practices.<br>

## Final Project: Part two 
In Part Two, I continued building on the foundation laid in Part One, refining the narrative and adding more detailed examples of dark patterns. This phase involved further user research to inform the design and ensure relevance to the target audience.<br>

## Final Project: Part three 
Part Three is the final iteration of my project, where I integrated feedback and enhanced the design for maximum engagement. I refined visualizations, added interactive elements, and included actionable advice to help users avoid falling victim to dark patterns in online shopping. <br>
