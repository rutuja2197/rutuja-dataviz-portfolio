# Critique by Design: MakeoverMonday  
This is a critique of the Animal Rights Index 2023 visualization from MakeoverMonday, evaluating its effectiveness in presenting global variations in animal welfare.

## Step one: the visualization

<b>Visualization Title:</b> Animal Rights Index 2023

<b>Source:</b> The Swiftest

<b>URL:</b> [https://theswiftest.com/animal-rights-index/#:~:text=Animal%20rights%20laws%20vary%20greatly,cruelty%20any%20way%20they%20can](https://theswiftest.com/animal-rights-index/#:~:text=Animal%20rights%20laws%20vary%20greatly,cruelty%20any%20way%20they%20can) 

<b>Summary:</b><br>
This visualization presents the Animal Rights Index 2023, ranking countries based on their animal welfare rights. The index considers factors such as the recognition of animal sentience, recognition of animal suffering, laws against animal cruelty, national fur-farming ban, support for the universal declaration of animal welfare, meat consumption per capita, percentage of protected areas, pesticide usage per hectare of cropland, and environmental performance index score. The data is displayed in a ranked table and is both color-coded as well as icon-based, highlighting variations in multiple attributes contributing to animal rights across different countries.

<b>Why I Chose This Visualization:</b><br>
I am an animal lover, and as I was going through different visualizations, this one instantly caught my eye. Since I have a pet dog, I was curious to check which country would be the best for my dog and which one would be the worst. Additionally, the visualization had a lot going on—multiple elements, colors, and rankings—which made it interesting to critique. I wanted to analyze whether all the information was presented effectively or if the complexity affected its clarity.

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
