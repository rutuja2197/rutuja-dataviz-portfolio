# Critique by Design: MakeoverMonday  
This is a critique of the Animal Rights Index 2023 visualization from MakeoverMonday, evaluating its effectiveness in presenting global variations in animal welfare.

## Step one: the visualization

<b>Visualization Title:</b> Animal Rights Index 2023

<b>Source:</b> The Swiftest

<b>URL:</b> [https://theswiftest.com/animal-rights-index/#:~:text=Animal%20rights%20laws%20vary%20greatly,cruelty%20any%20way%20they%20can](https://theswiftest.com/animal-rights-index/#:~:text=Animal%20rights%20laws%20vary%20greatly,cruelty%20any%20way%20they%20can) 

<b>Summary:</b><br>
This visualization presents the Animal Rights Index 2023, ranking countries based on their animal welfare rights. The index considers factors such as the recognition of animal sentience, recognition of animal suffering, laws against animal cruelty, national fur-farming ban, support for the universal declaration of animal welfare, meat consumption per capita, percentage of protected areas, pesticide usage per hectare of cropland, and environmental performance index score. The data is displayed in a ranked table and is both color-coded as well as icon-based, highlighting variations in multiple attributes contributing to animal rights across different countries.

<b>Why I Chose This Visualization:</b><br>
I am an animal lover, and as I was going through different visualizations, this one instantly caught my eye. Since I have a pet dog, I was curious to check which country would be the best for my dog and which one would be the worst. Additionally, the visualization had a lot going on—multiple elements, colors, and rankings—which made it interesting to critique. I wanted to analyze whether all the information was presented effectively or if the complexity affected its clarity.

## Step two: the critique
The Animal Rights Index visualization on <i>The Swiftest</i> presents several challenges that affect its effectiveness.  The design is cluttered with inconsistent icon usage and a lengthy table format, making it difficult for users to quickly find the top and bottom countries, which would be most relevant to the primary audience — pet owners or individuals seeking pet insurance, since <i>The Swiftest</i> is a pet insurance website. While factors and weights are provided at the end of the table, it’s hard to correlate them with the scores just by looking at the table, making it confusing. The lack of explanation for the grading system and the use of solid circles for some metrics and icons for others creates confusion.

The visualization offers moderate usefulness but falls short due to the difficulty in quickly extracting actionable insights from the long table format. In terms of completeness, while it covers a broad range of countries, the lack of detailed information on the scoring methodology and country-specific laws weakens its overall effectiveness. Perceptibility is hindered by the inconsistent use of icons and varying color schemes, which complicate the task of quickly understanding the data. The truthfulness of the data appears solid, and provides a reference of multiple sources. Intuitiveness suffers because of the overwhelming table format and unclear layout, making it hard for users to navigate. The aesthetics are inconsistent, with varying icon styles and color schemes detracting from a cohesive design. Lastly, the engagement level is moderate, as users may find the information relevant but not interactive enough to keep them engaged for long periods.

For improvement, I recommend using a bar graph to display the top 20 and bottom 20 countries in a more digestible format, allowing users to instantly grasp the key information. A more detailed table could be included for users looking for deeper insights. I would also suggest utilizing a uniform color gradient for all metrics—whether numerical or categorical—to improve the overall visual consistency and make the data easier to interpret. Finally, clarifying the scoring methodology and incorporating a clear explanation of the rankings would enhance the transparency and usefulness of the visualization.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
