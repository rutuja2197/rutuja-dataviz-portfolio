# Data Visualization Critiques
In this section, I analyze and critique data visualizations using a structured rubric and insights gained from the Telling Stories with Data course. Each critique focuses on:
- Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the visualization.
- Identifying areas for improvement based on design principles and audience needs.
- Providing informed recommendations grounded in heuristics and context, rather than subjective opinions.
The goal is to deconstruct visualizations effectively, offering actionable feedback to enhance clarity, effectiveness, and impact.

# Critique #1
In this critique, I have reviewed and analyzed two data visualizations.
